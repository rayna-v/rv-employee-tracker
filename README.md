# rv-employee-tracker

## The Task
I was tasked with building a solution for managing a company's employees and was expected to use Node.js with a minimum of both Inquirer and mySQL. 

## Motivation
This was my first chance to work closely with mySQL to create an application. As always, I like the code to be concise and flow in a logical order while creating an intuitive user experience. I really wanted to challenge myself to dive deeper into both mySQL's and Inquirer's functionality to learn more while also using other NPMs such as ascii, chalk, and console.table to create an aesthetically pleasing interface.
